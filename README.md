# Chemistry with Python

This repository is dedicated to demonstrating how **Python** can be used to solve and explore problems across various areas of **chemistry**. It includes practical examples and scripts for topics like chemical reactions, spectroscopy, kinetics, and data visualization—making chemistry more interactive, accessible, and efficient through programming.

## Overview

Python has become a powerful tool in the field of chemistry due to its versatility and ease of use. It is commonly used for kinetic and thermodynamic calculations, laboratory automation, and software development. In addition, Python’s extensive ecosystem of libraries has simplified tasks such as data analysis, visualization, and even advanced applications like quantum chemistry and molecular modeling.
