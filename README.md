# Chemistry with Python

The main idea of this repository is highlight how to solve Chemistry problems with Python.

## Overview

It is widely used for kinetic and thermodynamic calculations, as well as in quantum chemistry and molecular mechanics. Python is used extensively for laboratory automation and software development. Data analysis and visualization in chemistry have also become easier with the libraries available in Python.
