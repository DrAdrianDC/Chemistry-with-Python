## Chemical Kinetics

In chemistry one is often interested in how fast a chemical process proceeds. 


* For example, a simple first-order reaction A -> B would be described by d[A]/dt = -k[A], where [A] is the concentration of species A and k is the rate constant.



## How to Use

 Run the script.
