## Manipulating molecules with RDKit

### Overview

**RDKit** is an indispensable tool for the manipulation and standardization of chemical data, especially for preparing datasets for training artificial intelligence models.

In this notebook, we will explore how to use RDKit to perform the initial stages of chemical data manipulation, preparing them for AI model training. We will cover everything from visualizing molecules to removing chemically invalid molecules, as well as standardizing SMILES representations.
