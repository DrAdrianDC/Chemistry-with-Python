## RDKit and Python for AI models

For the context of AI applied to chemistry, one of the main challenges lies in the manipulation and standardization of molecular data. The RDKit library is a powerful tool for handling these tasks. The purpose of the work presented here is to explore and provide insights on the manipulation and standardization of chemical data, especially for preparing datasets for training artificial intelligence models.
