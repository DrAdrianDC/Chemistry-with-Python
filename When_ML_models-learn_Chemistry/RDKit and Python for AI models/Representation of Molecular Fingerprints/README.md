## Representation of Molecular Fingerprints with Python and RDKit for AI Models

### Overview

Molecule representation is a crucial step in the build of AI models in the field of chemistry. One of the most effective techniques for this representation is the use of molecular fingerprints. In this article, we will explore how fingerprints, specifically the **MACCS** and **Morgan** methods, can be generated from **SMILES** representations using the **RDKit** library.


In the present work, the notebook **Molecular-Fingerprints with Python and RDKit for AI models.ipynb**, molecular fingerprints (MACCS and Morgan fingerprints) are explored. By transforming chemical structures into numerical vectors, we can apply machine learning techniques to predict properties, classify compounds, etc.
