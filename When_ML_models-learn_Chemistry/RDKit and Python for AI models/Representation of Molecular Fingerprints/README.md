## Representation of Molecular Fingerprints with Python and RDKit for AI Models

Molecule representation is a crucial step in the build of AI models in the field of chemistry. One of the most effective techniques for this representation is the use of molecular fingerprints. In this article, we will explore how fingerprints, specifically the **MACCS** and **Morgan** methods, can be generated from **SMILES** representations using the **RDKit** library.
