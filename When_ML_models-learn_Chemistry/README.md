## Machine Learning Meets Chemistry


**Machine Learning** models "learn" **Chemistry** by being trained on large datasets of **chemical information**, including molecular structures, reaction outcomes, and molecular properties. For example, the **Machine Learning** models "learn" through various methods, such as converting molecules into numerical representations called fingerprints or SMILES strings, and then using algorithms to identify patterns and predict outcomes for new, unseen **chemical data**.
