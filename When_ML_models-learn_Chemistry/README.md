## Machine Learning Meets Chemistry


**Machine Learning** models capture **chemical knowledge** by being trained on large datasets containing **molecular structures**, **reaction outcomes**, and **molecular properties**. For example, these models analyze molecules represented as numerical fingerprints or SMILES strings, using algorithms to detect patterns and make predictions for new, unseen **chemical data**.
