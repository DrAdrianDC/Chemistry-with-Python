## Radioactive Decay 


## Radioactive Decay Equation

The equation for radioactive decay is given by:

![Radioactive Decay Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N(t)%20=%20N_0e^{-\lambda%20t})

Where:

- `N(t)` is the quantity of the substance at time `t`.
- `N_0` is the initial quantity of the substance.
- `Î»` is the decay constant, specific to each substance.
- `t` is the time that has passed.
- `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.


## Decay Constant Calculation

The decay constant (\( \lambda \)) represents the probability of decay of a radioactive nucleus per unit time. It is related to the **half-life** of the radioactive substance, which is the time required for half of the material to decay.

### Formula for Decay Constant:

\[
\lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}
\]

Where:
- \( \lambda \) is the decay constant (in units of time\(^{-1}\), e.g., per second).
- \( T_{1/2} \) is the **half-life** of the substance (the time required for half of the material to decay).
- \( \ln(2) \approx 0.693 \) is the natural logarithm of 2.

### Steps to Calculate the Decay Constant:

1. **Obtain the Half-Life**: The half-life \( T_{1/2} \) is typically provided or can be measured. It is the time required for half of the radioactive material to decay.

2. **Use the Formula**: Plug the half-life value into the formula to calculate the decay constant:
   
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{0.693}{T_{1/2}}
   \]

### Example Calculation:

Suppose a radioactive substance has a half-life of 10 years. The decay constant can be calculated as follows:

\[
\lambda = \frac{0.693}{10 \text{ years}} = 0.0693 \text{ years}^{-1}
\]

This means the probability of a single nucleus decaying in 1 year is approximately 6.93%.

### Relationship Between Half-Life and Decay Constant:

The decay constant gives a direct measure of how fast a substance decays:
- **Larger \( \lambda \)** means faster decay.
- **Smaller \( \lambda \)** means slower decay.
