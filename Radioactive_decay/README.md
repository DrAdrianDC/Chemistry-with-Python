## Radioactive Decay 

Certain atomic nuclei are unstable, and will over time decay into other nuclei, through emission of radiation. We call such atomic nuclei **radioactive**. The process of radioactive decay is completely random, but for large collections of atoms, we can model how much remains of the original matter after a certain time.


The equation for radioactive decay is given by:

Where:

- `N(t)` is the quantity of the substance at time `t`.
- `N_0` is the initial quantity of the substance.
- `λ` is the decay constant, specific to each substance.
- `t` is the time that has passed.
- `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.


## Decay Constant Calculation

The decay constant (λ) represents the probability of decay of a radioactive nucleus per unit time. It is related to the **half-life** of the radioactive substance, which is the time required for half of the material to decay.

   **Short half-life**: Isotopes with a short half-life are highly unstable and decay rapidly. They may release significant energy in a short period.
   **Long half-life**: Isotopes with a long half-life are less unstable, meaning they decay more slowly, sometimes over millions or billions of years. However, they still transform into more stable forms over time.

In summary, stable materials do not undergo radioactive decay, while unstable materials (radioactive isotopes) decay over time, with the half-life determining how quickly or slowly that process occurs. The half-life is a key metric that reflects the degree of instability of a material.

### Formula for Decay Constant:

![Decay Constant Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\lambda%20=%20\frac{\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}})

Where:
- `λ` is the decay constant (in units of time⁻¹, e.g., per second).
- `T₁/₂` is the **half-life** of the substance (the time required for half of the material to decay).
- `ln(2) ≈ 0.693` is the natural logarithm of 2.

### Steps to Calculate the Decay Constant:

1. **Obtain the Half-Life**: The half-life (`T₁/₂`) is typically provided or can be measured. It is the time required for half of the radioactive material to decay.

2. **Use the Formula**: Plug the half-life value into the formula to calculate the decay constant:
