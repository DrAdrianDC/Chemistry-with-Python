## Radioactive Decay 

The equation for radioactive decay describes the process by which a radioactive substance decreases in quantity over time. The number of undecayed atoms \( N(t) \) at time \( t \) is given by:

\[
N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}
\]

Where:
- \( N(t) \) is the quantity of the substance at time \( t \).
- \( N_0 \) is the initial quantity of the substance.
- \( \lambda \) is the decay constant, specific to each substance.
- \( t \) is the time that has passed.
- \( e \) is the base of the natural logarithm.
