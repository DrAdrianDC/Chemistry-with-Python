## Radioactive Decay 


## Radioactive Decay Equation

The equation for radioactive decay is given by:

Where:

- `N(t)` is the quantity of the substance at time `t`.
- `N_0` is the initial quantity of the substance.
- `λ` is the decay constant, specific to each substance.
- `t` is the time that has passed.
- `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.


## Decay Constant Calculation

The decay constant (λ) represents the probability of decay of a radioactive nucleus per unit time. It is related to the **half-life** of the radioactive substance, which is the time required for half of the material to decay.

### Formula for Decay Constant:

![Decay Constant Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\lambda%20=%20\frac{\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}})

Where:
- `λ` is the decay constant (in units of time⁻¹, e.g., per second).
- `T₁/₂` is the **half-life** of the substance (the time required for half of the material to decay).
- `ln(2) ≈ 0.693` is the natural logarithm of 2.

### Steps to Calculate the Decay Constant:

1. **Obtain the Half-Life**: The half-life (`T₁/₂`) is typically provided or can be measured. It is the time required for half of the radioactive material to decay.

2. **Use the Formula**: Plug the half-life value into the formula to calculate the decay constant:
