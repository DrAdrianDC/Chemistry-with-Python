# 🧪 pH and pOH Calculator

This small project allows you to calculate **pH**, **pOH**, **[H⁺]**, and **[OH⁻]** from any one value using basic acid-base chemistry.

## 💡 Features
- Calculate unknown concentrations
- Determine the acidity or basicity of a solution
- Streamlit-based interactive app

## 🚀 How to Run

Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run ph_calculator.py
```
