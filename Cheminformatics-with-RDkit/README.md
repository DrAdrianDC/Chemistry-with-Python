# Cheminformatics with RDkit


## Overview

Cheminformatics can be thought of as the intersection of data science, computer science, and chemistry as a means of better understanding and solving chemical problems. In this small project we will use a popular and versatile Python library known as RDkit.




## Features

**Molecular Representation:** Converts SMILES strings into RDKit molecule objects.
**Visualization:** Generates molecular structure images using RDKit.
**Substructure Matching:** Detects specific substructures (e.g., 5-membered rings) within molecules.
**Fingerprint Calculation:** Computes Morgan fingerprints to represent molecular environments.
**Similarity Comparison:** Compares two molecular structures using Tanimoto similarity.
**SMILES to SELFIES:** Converts SMILES strings to SELFIES for a more generalized molecular representation.
